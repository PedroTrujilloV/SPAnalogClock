###Features
1. Can set the time zone or choose from a list of time zone
2. Automatically detects the day or night and changes the background of the clock
3. Doesn't use `NSTimer	` to schedule the time, so it won't be blocked by any other UI operations.
4. Displays the name of the timezone

### How to use
1. Import the files `SPClockView.h` and `SPClockView.m` into your projects.
2. After adding the `SPClockView` into your parent view, set its `time zone` by calling `setTimeZone:` method.
